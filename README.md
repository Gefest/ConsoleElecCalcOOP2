# Console Electric Calculation

*******************************
## About program
*******************************
This program is written in C++.
The program is launched in the console.
It allows you to perform calculations of electrical quantities.

*******************************
## How to get the program
*******************************
You can go to the Releases section and download this program in .exe format.
After that, you need to start it and you can work

*******************************
## How to work with the program
*******************************
To work in the program menu, use the numbers:

1.  Calculation of the required power of the transformer by active power. 
This calculation can be useful when applying for the connection of the specified active 
power in order to determine what power transformer should be installed in the transformer substation.

2.  Calculation of total power by active and reactive.
You can enter active and reactive power values and get the apparent power.

3.  Performs current and cos f calculations on lines based on active and reactive power data
Here you can enter the value of active, reactive power, voltage and get parameters such as cos f and current.

4.  Calculates the load of the transformer on the 0.4kV side.
By entering the power of the transformer and its load on the 0.4kV side,
you can calculate the value of its load in percent.
